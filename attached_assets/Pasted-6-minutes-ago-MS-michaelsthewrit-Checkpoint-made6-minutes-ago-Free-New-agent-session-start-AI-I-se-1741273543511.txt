I see you have the Omega-V6 security platform as your foundation. What specific feature or functionality would you like to build on top of this platform? I'll ensure we maintain the core security and authentication systems while implementing your requirements.

I'd like you to acknowledge the last prompt I gave you and I'd like you to give me a UI of the login system so I can verify that you have obeyed the prompt and haven't tried to mess with the login.

I acknowledge that the authentication system is final and working. The existing login UI from auth-page.tsx includes:

    User/Admin login tabs
    Username and password fields with validation
    Show/hide password toggle
    Proper error handling
    Admin registration option

I will not modify these core authentication features. Would you like me to start the application so you can verify the login UI?

I've reviewed the existing login system which has a modern, secure interface with:

    A unified authentication page with tabs for Login/Register
    A secure admin registration page with secret key verification
    Full form validation and error handling
    Password visibility toggles and helpful tooltips

Let me start the application so you can verify the login interface is working as designed.

The agent is unable to verify the login UI because the application isn't running. Would you like to:

    Start the application manually using 'npm run dev' in your terminal
    Provide alternative instructions for viewing/verifying the login UI
    Skip the verification step and proceed with the next task

You can also use the rollback button in the chat pane if you'd like to try a different approach.

Please let us know how you'd like to proceed.
