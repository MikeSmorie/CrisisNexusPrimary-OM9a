# Prompt: Intelligent False Report Flagging with Reassessment Fallback

## Overview:
Implement a system in the Emergency Module that:
1. Detects and flags potential prank or false emergency reports.
2. Issues a formal legal warning and logs device info.
3. **But** also allows for intelligent reassessment if the user:
   - Appears sincere in retracting the prank.
   - Indicates they made a mistake (e.g., "wrong tab", "ongoing", "accident").
   - Restates the emergency clearly.

## Required Behavior:

### 1. When prank is detected:
- Display this warning:
  ```text
  üö® You are now flagged for false emergency reporting. This is a criminal offense punishable by law. Your call details and device information have been logged for investigation.
  ```
- Escalation is paused.
- Mark status: `flagged_for_false_reporting = true`.

### 2. Fallback Recovery Logic:
If within the next 3 caller messages any of the following patterns are detected:
  - ‚Äúsorry‚Ä¶ meant to send that elsewhere‚Äù
  - ‚Äúthis emergency is ongoing‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúI made a mistake‚Äù
  - ‚Äúplease help‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúI was wrong / misclicked‚Äù
  - Message includes a *repeat of the original emergency description*

THEN:
- Unflag the call: `flagged_for_false_reporting = false`
- Re-evaluate context tags and threat level
- IF danger is still valid:
  - Re-initiate dispatch logic.
  - Log:
    ```text
    ‚úÖ Emergency re-evaluation complete. Dispatch resuming. Caller reinstated after clarification.
    ```

### 3. System Tagging:
- Add a contextual badge: `üß† Recovered From Misflag`
- Add audit trail entry with timestamps and rationale for reinstatement.

## AI Translator / Operator Message Examples:
- After reinstatement:
  ```text
  We have reassessed your report based on your clarification. Emergency dispatch has resumed. Stay on the line and provide updates.
  ```

- If prank is confirmed without recovery:
  ```text
  Your actions have been logged and forwarded to authorities. Misuse of emergency services is a serious offense.
  ```

## Additional Notes:
- Retain all original messages in full dialogue log with flags.
- Status tags must reflect: `FALSE FLAG (recovered)` or `FALSE FLAG (confirmed)`.
