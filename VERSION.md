# Omega-V8.3 :: Global Logging + Observability

## Release Summary
Complete global error handling, request logging, and observability infrastructure implementation for enhanced system monitoring and debugging capabilities.

## Core Features Implemented

### üîç Database Schema
- **omega_logs** table with comprehensive logging fields
- Support for severity levels (info, warning, error)
- Event type categorization (login, logout, failed_request, subscription_change, payment_attempt, error_boundary, api_error, user_action, system_event)
- Stack trace capture and metadata storage
- User relationship tracking

### üõ† Backend Infrastructure
- **Global logging utility** (`lib/logs.ts`) with standardized log format
- **Enhanced middleware** for automatic request/error logging
- **API routes** for log retrieval and statistics (supergod-only access)
- **Client error logging endpoint** for frontend error capture
- **Authentication event tracking** integration

### üé® Frontend Components
- **React Error Boundary** with automatic error reporting
- **Admin Logs Dashboard** with advanced filtering and visualization
- **Real-time log monitoring** with severity icons and expandable details
- **Export functionality** for log data analysis
- **Dark/light mode compatibility** with Tailwind design system

### üîê Security & Access Control
- **Supergod-only access** to system logs
- **Role-based filtering** and user context tracking
- **Sanitized error messages** preventing sensitive data exposure
- **Authentication state logging** for security monitoring

### üìä Observability Features
- **System-wide error capture** on both client and server
- **Performance monitoring** with request duration tracking
- **Failed request logging** with detailed context
- **Statistical dashboards** showing error rates and system health
- **Stack trace preservation** for debugging capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Log Format Standard
```
[timestamp] [user.role] [endpoint] [event type]: message
```

### Automated Logging Events
- User login/logout activities
- Failed API requests (4xx/5xx responses)
- Subscription changes and payment attempts
- Frontend error boundary triggers
- System-level errors with full stack traces

### Admin Dashboard Features
- **Real-time filtering** by severity, event type, user, and time range
- **Expandable log entries** with metadata and stack traces
- **Export capabilities** for external analysis
- **Statistics overview** with error counts and trends
- **Responsive design** optimized for monitoring workflows

## Integration Points
- **Error Boundary** integrated at app root level
- **Middleware logging** on all API routes
- **Authentication flow** logging for security auditing
- **Payment system** event tracking
- **Admin interface** accessible via `/admin/logs`

This release establishes comprehensive observability infrastructure enabling developers and administrators to monitor system health, debug issues effectively, and maintain operational excellence across the Omega platform.
